                                            Meta's vision for the metaverse as a new frontier for connection and
                                            collaboration. Emphasizing the importance of open standards and
                                            interoperability, Meta seeks to create a diverse and inclusive metaverse
                                            through collaboration with tech companies, creators, and developers. While
                                            acknowledging challenges like privacy and safety, Meta remains committed to
                                            addressing these issues and fostering positive impact through ongoing
                                            dialogue and collaboration.

                                            Today, I want to talk about something that's been on my mind a lot lately:
                                            the incredible power of social media to bring people together and build
                                            communities. At its core, social media is about connection. It's about
                                            connecting with old friends, staying in touch with family members across the
                                            globe, and discovering new people who share your interests and passions. And
                                            when I think about the impact that these connections can have, it's truly
                                            inspiring. One of the things I'm most proud of is how Facebook, and other
                                            social media platforms, have helped to democratize communication. In the
                                            past, if you wanted to reach a large audience, you needed access to
                                            traditional media channels like newspapers or television. But now, anyone
                                            with an internet connection can share their thoughts, ideas, and experiences
                                            with the world. Of course, with this power comes responsibility. We've seen
                                            how social media can be used to spread misinformation, sow division, and
                                            even incite violence. And as someone who's deeply committed to creating a
                                            more open and connected world, I believe it's our responsibility to address
                                            these challenges head-on. That's why we're constantly investing in new
                                            technologies and initiatives to keep our platforms safe and secure. From
                                            AI-powered content moderation tools to partnerships with fact-checkers and
                                            independent researchers, we're working tirelessly to ensure that everyone
                                            can have a positive and meaningful experience on our platforms. But
                                            ultimately, I believe that the benefits of social media far outweigh the
                                            drawbacks. Whether it's helping small businesses reach new customers,
                                            connecting activists and organizers to amplify their voices, or simply
                                            bringing joy and laughter into people's lives, social media has the power to
                                            change the world for the better. So let's continue to use this incredible
                                            tool to build bridges, foster understanding, and create a more connected
                                            world for generations to come.
